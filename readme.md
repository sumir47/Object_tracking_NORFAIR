# 📹 Multi-Object Tracking Desktop Application

## 📄 Description
This project is a desktop application that leverages **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and **Norfair** for object tracking. The application provides a user-friendly **PyQt5** GUI where users can select a device (like a webcam) or upload a video file to analyze object movements in real-time.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection** using YOLOv5.
- **Multi-Object Tracking** with the Norfair Tracker.
- Supports both **Live Webcam Feed** and **Video File Upload**.
